   BSDS ARCHIVE — SEMESTER 1 DATA
   =====================================================================
   This is the ONE file to edit for everything on the Semester I page:
   Materials, Syllabus, Timetable, and Calendar. It attaches itself to
   the shared SEMESTER_DATA object (declared once, safely, below) so
   semester1.html only ever needs to load THIS file — not everyone
   else's semester data too. When sem2 is ready, copy this file to
   sem2.js, change every "sem1" below to "sem2", and load it from
   semester2.html instead.

   Nothing here needs a build step — just edit the plain JavaScript
   objects/arrays and save. Reload the page to see changes.

   ADDING A PDF TO A MATERIAL ITEM
   --------------------------------
   Every material item can optionally carry a "file" property — a path
   to a PDF, relative to the site's root, e.g.:

       {t:"Descriptive Statistics & Summary Measures", m:"PDF · 18p",
        file:"files/statistics/descriptive-statistics.pdf"}

   1. Drop the actual PDF into the files/ folder (organise it however
      you like — the four course subfolders already there are just a
      suggestion, e.g. files/statistics/, files/mathematics/, ...).
   2. Set "file" to that same path on the matching item below.
   3. That's it — the drawer automatically shows Download + Open
      buttons for any item with a "file" path, and "Open" launches
      viewer.html, which renders the PDF right in the browser (works
      on both phones and desktops, scrolling continuously through
      every page).

   Items WITHOUT a "file" property still show up in the list, just
   with a "Not uploaded yet" note instead of the two buttons — so you
   can list out a course's full set of materials before you've
   actually uploaded every PDF.

   ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR THIS SEMESTER
   --------------------------------
   The Announcements tab on this page reads from a plain text file at
   data/sem1-announcements.txt — edit that file directly, same format
   as the site-wide one on the homepage. See that file for the format.

       "units": [...]              — one flat numbered list (see
                                      Statistics I below).
       "groups": [{heading, units}] — one or more NAMED sections, each
                                      restarting its own numbering at 1
                                      (see Mathematics I below, which is
                                      really "One Variable Calculus" +
                                      "Linear Algebra", not one list).
