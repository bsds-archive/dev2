/* =====================================================================
   BSDS ARCHIVE — SEMESTER LIST
   =====================================================================
   Drives the vertical timeline on semesters.html (the semester picker).
   Only semesters.html needs to load this file — semesterN.html pages
   load their own js/data/semN.js instead (see that file for why the
   data got split this way).

   key      : must match a key in SEMESTER_DATA below (e.g. "sem1")
   href     : the page to link to, or null if not published yet
              ("Coming soon" is shown automatically when href is null)
   courses  : short list shown as pills — purely cosmetic preview

   YEAR GROUPING: renderSemesterTimeline() (js/app.js) groups this array
   two entries at a time into collapsible "1st Year / 2nd Year / …"
   dropdowns — index 0-1 → 1st Year, 2-3 → 2nd Year, and so on. That
   grouping is positional, not something you set per entry, so keep
   semesters listed in order (I, II, III, …) as below.
